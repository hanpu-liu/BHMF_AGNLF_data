## Theoretical black hole mass function (BHMF), AGN luminosity function (LF), and black hole merger rates

This repo constains two folders.

* **Li2024**: theoretical LF and BHMF of heavy-seed BH accretion models.  Described in Li et al. (2024), *Reconstruction of Cosmic Black Hole Growth and Mass Distribution from Quasar Luminosity Functions at z > 4: Implications for Faint and Low-mass Populations in JWST* ([https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969...69L/abstract](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969...69L/abstract)). Forked from [https://github.com/WenxiuLiii/BHMF_QLF_data](https://github.com/WenxiuLiii/BHMF_QLF_data). Data description is available in the README.md file in the folder.

* **Liu_and_Inayoshi_2024**: theoretical LF, BHMF, and BH merger rates of multiple-seed BH evolution models.  Described in Liu & Inayoshi (2024), *Title* ([url](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/url)). Data description is available in the README.md file in the folder.
