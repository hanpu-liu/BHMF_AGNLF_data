## Theoretical black hole mass function (BHMF), AGN luminosity function (LF), and black hole merger rates

This repo constains two folders.

* **Li2024**: theoretical LF and BHMF of heavy-seed BH accretion models.  Described in Li et al. (2024), **Reconstruction of Cosmic Black Hole Growth and Mass Distribution from Quasar Luminosity Functions at z > 4: Implications for Faint and Low-mass Populations in JWST** ([ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...969...69L/abstract)). Forked from [https://github.com/WenxiuLiii/BHMF_QLF_data](https://github.com/WenxiuLiii/BHMF_QLF_data). Data description is available in the `README.md` file in the folder.

* **Liu_and_Inayoshi_2024**: theoretical LF, BHMF, and BH merger rates of multiple-seed BH evolution models.  Described in Liu & Inayoshi (2024), **Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers** ([arXiv:2409.18194](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18194)). Data description and visualization example are available in the `README_example.ipynb` file in the folder.
